# Visas and Immigration

Information and personal experience for various visas and other immigration matters.

## The Dutch Startup Visa

I applied for this visa as a follow on from the "Orientation Visa" which made some things simpler. There are a few groups you have to make and keep happy:

### Chamber of commerce / KVK

They have some specific requirements about registering a business (even as a sole proprietor or "ZZP"/ "Eenmanszaak" in NL) no matter where you come from. They are efficient but mainly deal in Dutch.

### The IND / Alien office

They have specific requirements based on your citizenship status and are responsible for issuing the residence card that lets you live and work (for yourself) in NL. They are efficient but create a _lot_ of paperwork. I had to prove I had €15k in a bank account and fill out a lot of forms. I seem to remember  the [points system](https://ind.nl/en/documents/07-2022/dutch-scoring-system-business-of-essential-interest.pdf) being important as well, but I can't find reference if that list is still relevant these days or not.

### The RVO

They are responsible for assessing whether your business is "innovative" enough to be of benefit to the Dutch economy. I don't think my startup ([ritza.co](https://ritza.co)) is especially innovative, but I had to write out a business plan and a few other documents which I liberally sprinkled with a few buzzwords and they accepted me).

### The Faciliator

These are small businesses that managed to get a certification to become official "facilitators" of startups in Netherlands. From what I can tell, it's quite difficult to become one so there aren't that many and the ones that exist are just trying to make a quick buck. I used "Launch Cafe" in Groningen (not sure if they're still around), and paid them something like €500/month for coworking space for the full year that I didn't need which was one of the conditions of them facilitating me. I saw other faciliators who made their facilitation dependent on you doing a short startup course with them (thousands of euros for a few weeks/months). In the end they didn't do much for me except write the one letter which let me check one box.
