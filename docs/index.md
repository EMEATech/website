# Welcome to EMEATech

EMEATech is a community of people with an interest in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, working in fields relating to technology, including software engineering, machine learning, devops and others.

There are already many strong online technology focused communities, but many of these are mainly active in timezones that overlap with the US, and discussion around jobs, culture, etc tends to be US-heavy too. For example, many of these communities advertise jobs, but even the ones advertised as 'fully remote' expect you to overlap with US working hours, or even have US work authorization.
